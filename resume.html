        <h4>Software Engineer | Game Developer | 3D Artist and Animator</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>I am a software engineer with experience in traditional software development, game design, and web development. My experience exists through all stages of development;
            from creative design and planning, developing design tools, implementation of various backend and frontend systems, testing, and maintenance. I have a plethora of 
            knowledge in various languages, from Python to Java to C# to C and all the way to x86 Assembly. I also have some knowledge in subjects outside of coding, such as
            cyber-security and computer networks. My passion is in game development; however, I am open to all roles that involve coding in some form.

                    <h3>Venomic Games (2021 - Present)</h3>
                    <p><b>Project: Unsung Heroes 1898</b></p>
                    <p><b>Engineer</b></p>
                    <p>Developed the movetech responsible for player movement and the various systems responsible for gunplay. Created a system that allows players to "shift"
                        between multiple combatants at any time. Produced a unique gameplay twist and control scheme for artillery and cavalry units, seperate from the standard
                        infantry units. Developed a modular, expandable, and complex AI system featuring a state machine and hierarchical orders. Created a troop controller that 
                        allows players to choose preset battle strategies or create new ones from scratch. Developed a battle management system that keeps track of the current state 
                        of a battle and developed a profile system that can easily be adjusted to be tailor suited for each soldier. 
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Artist & Animator</b></p>
                    <p>Modeled historically accurate firearms of the Spanish-American War using reference photos and videos. Developed and refined firearm animations to behave and
                        operate like their real-world counterparts. Modeled and animated infantry, cavalry, and artillery units with historically accurate uniforms, while also keeping
                        performance costs low for smoother gameplay. Created and refined various animation controllers for the soldier units, allowing animations to dynamically change 
                        and blend with one another based on player input. Modeled various environmental buildings as well as the game's interactive museum. Designed, developed, and 
                        iterated the game's UI, from the main battle UI to the various menus at the start of the game.  
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Marketing</b></p>
                    <p>Initially managed the social media accounts for Venomic Games, documenting progress on the game and engaging with the community. Listened and recorded public
                        feedback to improve various aspects of the game. Created and maintained a company website from scratch in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to further solidify 
                        Venomic Games and completed nearly all the various legal requirements needed for the company.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Additional Misc. Work</b></p>
                    <p>Designed the various levels using historical accounts and retellings of the battles in the war. Completed a soft remake of the game after the initial Alpha 1
                        launch, rebuilding most of the game from scratch to higher quality standards. Performed much R&D for the project, from human model creation to the various
                        systems embedded in the game.

                    <h3>Infinite Digital Monkeys LLC (2023 - 2024)</h3>
                    <p><b>Project: Syke</b></p>
                    <p><b>Gameplay Engineer</b></p>
                    <p>Developed the volume-based gravity manipulation tool in C++ and was key in the research of the game's other gravity mechanics that allows players to
                        walk on various vertical, up-side down, and inclined surfaces. Designed and developed a large portion of the game's wold event system, that allows
                        designers to create triggers for the player that can change the environment. Created the backend logic for various in-game puzzles, including (but not 
                        limited to) the library level's book cypher puzzle and the tutorial's radial disk puzzle. Developed a tutorial prompt system that, though fully 
                        completed and tested, was eventually scraped from the final version. Developed a significant portion of the game's startup menu system, including the 
                        settings menu and the ability for players to save, load, or create saves within "save slots." Added a few cutscenes within the tutorial level.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Level Design</b></p>
                    <p>Acted as a key designer and developer behind many of the library level's mechanics, such as book searching, triggerable level manipulation, the
                        aforementioned book cypher puzzle, and the level's gravity manipulation mechanics. Acted as one of the two principle developers for the project's 
                        "strike team," responsible for designing and developing the tutorial level. Consulted frequently with other level designers to demonstrate various
                        development tools personally created, as well as in creating the aforementioned library and tutorial levels.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Technical Artist</b></p>
                    <p>Initially worked with the art team to create more complex art and animations. Modeled, rigged, animated, and coded a 3D walkway that would twist and bend
                        in the middle, inspired by concept art depicting a distorted and twisting hallway (this was later scrapped). Created animations for walkway in the final
                        puzzle of the library level and created various puzzle animations in the tutorial level.

                    <p><b>Website Developer (Volunteer)</b></p>
                    <p>Initially maintained the old website for a small local church based in Colorado Springs, CO. Designed, developed, and tested the new and current Site
                        using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Created a responsive UI that scales between desktop and mobile uses. Developed interactive elements on the site, such
                        as an event schedule in the form of clickable cards, and formed a repository of the Parish's weekly bulletins. Added multi-language support (English and
                        Spanish) to broaden the accessibility of the site. Continued to update the site weekly to address site issues, Parish updates, and post weekly-scheduled 
                        events.
